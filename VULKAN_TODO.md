## 🟠 HIGH PRIORITY - Post-Processing Effects (Placeholder Implementations)

All post-processing filters have placeholder implementations that don't actually work.

### 17. Synchronization Audit
**Files:** All `Vulkan*.cpp` files
- [ ] Audit all image layout transitions
- [ ] Ensure proper pipeline barriers between passes
- [ ] Verify queue family ownership transfers (if using multiple queues)
- [ ] Check for race conditions in multi-threaded rendering
- [ ] Ensure descriptor sets are not modified while in use
- [ ] Verify proper use of VK_PIPELINE_STAGE flags

**Impact:** Prevents validation errors, crashes, and rendering corruption.

---

### 18. Memory Management Audit
**Files:** All `Vulkan*.cpp` files
- [ ] Verify all vkDestroy* calls match vkCreate* calls
- [ ] Check for memory leaks with validation layers
- [ ] Audit deferred deletion queue behavior ([VulkanRenderer.h:94-95](Sources/Draw/VulkanRenderer.h#L94-L95))
- [ ] Ensure proper cleanup on renderer destruction
- [ ] Test cleanup during swapchain recreation

---

### 19. Descriptor Set Pool Optimization
**File:** `VulkanDescriptorPool.cpp`
- [ ] Review descriptor set allocation patterns
- [ ] Ensure sets are reused, not recreated each frame
- [ ] Implement descriptor set caching
- [ ] Monitor pool exhaustion and implement dynamic growth

---

## 🟢 LOW PRIORITY - Performance Optimizations

### 20. Push Constants
**Files:** Various
- [ ] Identify small uniform updates suitable for push constants
- [ ] Replace uniform buffer updates with push constants where appropriate
- [ ] Measure performance improvement

**Impact:** Reduces CPU overhead for small uniform updates.

---

### 21. Memory Aliasing ✅
**Files:** Resource management classes
- [x] Identify temporary resources (intermediate render targets)
- [x] Implement memory aliasing for temporary resources ([VulkanTemporaryImagePool.h](Sources/Draw/VulkanTemporaryImagePool.h))
- [ ] Measure memory usage reduction
- [ ] Update filters to use the pool (currently available via `VulkanRenderer::GetTemporaryImagePool()`)

**Impact:** Reduces GPU memory consumption.
